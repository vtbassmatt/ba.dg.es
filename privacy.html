    <p>This page is essentially a toy.  I'm not tracking
    much, and I'll be happy to delete all your records upon request.
    I store your name from Facebook, as well as user IDs
    and the list of badges you've earned for every site you connect.</p>
    
    <p>Want out?  Email vtbassmatt@gmail.com with your full name and I'll delete
    you from the database as soon as humanly possible.</p>
    
    <p>Note: if you allow this app to access one of your social networks, and then you later
    revoke that access, the app will still have a cached copy of the
    badges you earned.  I hope to get around to a "drop all data" button shortly.</p>
