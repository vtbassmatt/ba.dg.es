        <p>ba.dg.es will (eventually) show you all your badges across all your social networks.</p>
        <h2>Why??</h2>
        <p>I wanted to play with some of the social networking endpoints.  I like badges, too.  This is something of an exercise in how NOT to write a modern web app - I didn't use any frameworks and it really shows.</p>
        <h2>How??</h2>
        <p>First, log in with Facebook - that way I can keep track of who you are across multiple networks.</p>
        <p>Then, click any network's button to connect or refresh your badges from that site.  For example, click on FourSquare to connect to your FourSquare account.</p>
